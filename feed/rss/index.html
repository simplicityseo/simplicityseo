Looking for marketing resources for charities for this year?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is £91,919.60 of grant marketing resources for charities you can take advantage of in 2018 that will make a huge difference to any charity, big or small.</p><h2></h2><h2>What’s the catch?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Large companies like Google like to support charities and non-profits, and this is how they do it. As long as you’re a registered charity in England or Wales you can take advantage of this huge boost to any marketing budget.</p><p>Although you can apply and manage these grants yourself for free, I would recommend you get an SEO agency to manage your account to ensure you’re getting in front of the right people, and as many of them as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are the charity marketing grants in detail…</strong></p><h2></h2><h2>Google Ad Grant &#8211; $10,000 per month (£7243.30 per month)</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re not applying to any other advertising grants other than this one, you’ll still do well. $10,000 a month in pay per click is an enviable budget.</p><p>If you&#8217;re going to apply for just one of these marketing resources for charities &#8211; this is the one.</p><p>With PPC (pay per click), you specify where you want to show up, and what terms you want to show up for, then you pay for each person that clicks your link.</p><p>The price per click differs according to many factors such as the competition and how relevant your site is to the search term. So Google’s giving you over £7,000 each month to reach people – if you’re a small or medium charity you’ll need several meetings as to what you want to target and how you’re going to handle the increase in exposure.</p><h3></h3><h3>What’s the eligibility?</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be eligible for the Google grant, you have to:</p><ol><li>Hold valid charity status</li><li>Be a non-discriminatory charity</li><li>Have a live website with substantial content</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can read their full T&amp;C’s and <a href="http://google.co.uk/grants">apply for the grant HERE</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>YouTube non-profit programme</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With YouTubes non-profit program you can make your videos more effective with donation cards and direct linking.</p><p>Donation cards let you add a donate button to videos, making the process of donating to your charity a lot easier.</p><p>Normal videos can’t link outside youtube in the video. If you’re part of Youtubes non-profit program you can add links to external campaigns using link anywhere cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/nonprofits">Sign up </a>for the non-profit program here</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>eBay for charity</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Make it easy for eBay sellers to support you – a portion of their sales gets taken as a donation, and organised by PayPal gets sent directly to you.</p><p><a href="http://www.missionfish.org.uk/">http://www.missionfish.org.uk/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Facebook Grants &#8211; £5000</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook marketing for charities has an amazing ROI, and this grant has the complete package. The Transform Foundation have teamed up with Farewill to provide designers, developers and performance marketers to deliver a profitable campaign.</p><p>There are several steps to apply for this grant, ranging from the initial application form to a telephone interview and paperwork being sent out to review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The eligibility criteria for this grant is the strictest I’ve mentioned here:</p><ol><li>Until they launch their program for smaller charities, they are generally funding charities with an <strong>income of between £350k and £30M</strong>.</li><li>You <strong>must be registered</strong> with  the Charities Commission, the OSCR or the Charity Commission</li><li>They do <strong>not fund general software or hardware procurement projects</strong>, the development of apps or CRM projects.</li><li>You must be able to clearly demonstrate a <strong>good return on investment</strong></li><li>You’ll need a Facebook presence of <strong>over 1000 likes</strong>.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The great thing about this grant is that if you deliver a good ROI with the £5000 grant, you can apply for a further £10,000 grant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.transformfoundation.org.uk/facebook-grants">https://www.transformfoundation.org.uk/facebook-grants</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Wrap up</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re organising a charity’s marketing, there’s no reason not to apply for some of these marketing resources for charities as they will be able to expose your message to a wider audience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With <a href="https://simplicityseo.co.uk/swanseaseo/charity-marketing/">charity marketing</a>, we provide free advice, so if you’ve any questions message us below and we’ll get right back to you.</p><p><!-- Begin MailChimp Signup Form --><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; } /* Add your own MailChimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block.

You give them your literature, and end the meeting there, without learning about their business or even trying to close them.</p><p>Now most of you will be saying <strong>“I don’t do that!”</strong>. OK. So why do you do it when it comes to digital marketing?</p><p>A trap that a lot of small businesses fall into is not guiding the visitor, just like you’d do in a sales meeting – explaining their problem, and showing there is a solution – you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“But I have a services/products/contact page”</strong></p><p>Great! But that’s like handing them your flyer and leaving them to follow up.

Share? Sign up? Phone up? Most visitors won’t be ready to buy from you, you’ll need to guide them through a journey.</p><p>Now I’m not saying everyone should get rid of their product pages (some visitors will go to that and become a customer) But your website is a great way to grab their attention and start to <strong>develop a relationship</strong>.</p><p>But before they are going to your website, you can get in front of them and start to build that relationship. How?</p><h2>Social Media</h2><p><a href="http://localhost:8888/wordpress2">Social media marketing</a> is a great way to ‘pre-sell’ and get on the radar of your prospects. If you’re getting engaged, and become a part of their community, they’ll get to know you.</p><p><strong><em>Just don’t Jam what you’re offering down their throat all the time…</em></strong></p><p>Here’s the difference between handing them a leaflet and interacting with them…</p><p>How likely are you to get out your credit card, or phone up a company asking for a service the first time you visit their website?</p><blockquote><p>That’s because it’s too much commitment, too soon.</p></blockquote><p>How likely are you to give your email address for a solution to a problem you’re facing on your first interaction? – A lot more likely, especially if you’re getting free value that will help you.</p><p><strong>So how can this help you?</strong></p><p>If you’ve got a list of prospects you can get in front of via email, you can carry on the conversation, providing them value and get them to like and trust you.</p><p>After several emails with you helping them with common problems they’re facing, if you <em>*then*</em> send an email trying to close them – they are much more likely to convert.</p><p><strong>Turn it more into a conversation and less into a broadcast.</strong></p><h2>How This Affects How You Get Your Visitors</h2><p>The more you personalise the journey your visitor takes, the more sales you’ll get. When searching Google, people use ‘long tail keywords’ (3 or more words, very specific). This means you can create a very personal experience for your visitors, sending them to a page that exactly shows what they’re looking for.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The great thing is long tail keywords are easier to rank for.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I’ll give you an example;</p><ul><li>Someone <strong>searches Google</strong> for ‘Best Mothers Day flowers&#8217;</li><li>They click and <strong>go through to a page</strong> about mothers day flowers and the best types for them.</li><li>They <strong>find the exact information</strong> they&#8217;re looking for, and then&#8230;</li><li>If they go to leave the page (when the curser goes towards the back button) – a pop up comes up offering them a guide on how to choose the best mothers day flowers. (exit intent popup)</li></ul><blockquote><p>56% of companies currently use an email marketing provider and are 75% or more likely to be purchasers of marketing automation software over the next year. &#8211; <a href="http://insight.venturebeat.com">VentureBeat</a></p></blockquote><p><strong>Boom, you’ve got their email address</strong>. You can keep providing them value; for example send an email ‘The 5 main types of bouquets and what you must never give your Mum’ (I’ve no idea about flowers, so forgive my ignorance)</p><p>The point is &#8211; provide value, then add a link to your order page. The more emails you collect, the more buyers you’ll get with each email.</p><p><strong>This works with any business</strong></p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://simplicityseo.co.uk/you-dont-want-prospects/">You don’t want your prospects to buy from you</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://simplicityseo.co.uk">Simplicity SEO</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://simplicityseo.co.uk/you-dont-want-prospects/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Making your epic online marketing strategy</title><link>https://simplicityseo.co.uk/making-your-epic-online-marketing-strategy/</link> <comments>https://simplicityseo.co.uk/making-your-epic-online-marketing-strategy/#respond</comments> <pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2017 02:06:23 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter Griffiths]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Marketing Strategy]]></category> <category><![CDATA[PPC]]></category> <category><![CDATA[SEO]]></category> <category><![CDATA[SMM]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://localhost:8888/wordpress2/?p=102</guid> <description><![CDATA[<p>If you don’t have a solid online marketing strategy for your business yet, don’t worry.

You’re not alone.</p><blockquote><p>According to Smart Insights, 47% of businesses don’t have a set plan or strategy</p></blockquote><p>BUT….</p><p>How much business are you losing as a result?</p><p>Or the question that you want answered… How much more business will you get investing in digital marketing?</p><blockquote><p>66% of small businesses in the UK are increasing their online marketing budget over the next year &#8211; Ebay Marketing survey</p></blockquote><h2>Where do you get clients at the moment?</h2><h3>Newspapers</h3><p>The reach for newspaper ads is rapidly declining, people are no longer picking up a newspaper for their content. It’s online. (And most people aren’t going to the newspaper’s website)</p><p>An average cost to reach 1000 people via newspaper is around £30. With search advertising it’s usually around 20p to £5.</p><p>You could literally get over 100 times the reach (to an even more specific audience) <strong>for the same cost</strong>!</p><h3>Yellow Pages</h3><p>Now, almost all the clients I’ve worked with have used yellow pages at some point (for paid advertising).</p><p>If you’re paying for this, do you know your ROI?</p><p>I’m willing to bet 95% of you will be very shocked if you tracked it.</p><p>Do you still use the Yellow Pages to find a business? <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/10-stats-to-justify-seo/36762/">93% of online experiences begin with a search engine.</a></p><p>Now I’m not trying to dishearten you, countless businesses still get clients from traditional media &#8211; and profitably. But with that media receding, <strong>you can get better results with an online marketing strategy</strong> &#8211; especially if you’re a small or medium sized business.</p><h2>Strategy</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So you’ve heard you need an online marketing strategy to start marketing online, but <strong>where do you start?</strong> Well grab a cup of coffee and I’ll guide you through it &#8211; I’ll be here when you get back 🙂</p><p>Before you spend a penny on online marketing for your business, you need to have a strategy in place, otherwise you could just be throwing money at the wrong audience.</p><p><strong>Imagine if you sold phones, but only got in front of people that had bought one the day before.</strong></p><h3>Your Online Marketing Strategy…</h3><p>Your online marketing strategy should be documented, so you can refer to it in the future.</p><p>What I would recommend is grabbing a pen and paper and jotting down these so you can look at them when thinking about any sort of advertising online.</p><h3>Your Target Customer</h3><p>Many business mentors refer to these as client personas. If you look at your client base at the moment, create an imaginary person who falls within your demographic.</p><p>Name them, write down their age, profession, where he would be online, which social networks is he on, what is a major problem he’s facing?</p><p>For example if you’re an accountant:</p><p>Alex Waterman<br /> Age: 32<br /> Proffession: plumber<br /> Social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn<br /> Problem: getting tax return in on time</p><p>Write down around 3 profiles. This way any marketing you do you can ask yourself &#8211; “Is this marketing targeting Alex, Sue or David?”</p><p>This will ensure you’re targeting your demographic and help you getting in front of people like them.</p><h3>Your Funnel</h3><p>Making a sales funnel is <strong>creating a path for your prospects</strong>, so you can grab their attention and put them into your funnel, then guide them along the path to become a client.</p><p>The idea behind a funnel is to convert prospects into buyers by:</p><ul><li>Showing your prospect to <strong>know</strong> who you are</li><li>Getting people to <strong>like</strong> what you’re doing and your company</li><li>Teaching them to <strong>trust</strong> your brand so they know you can follow through on promises</li><li>Getting them to the point where they <strong>buy</strong></li></ul><p>Marketing can then be focussed on getting people into the funnel, rather than marketing focussed on buying from you straight away.</p><blockquote><p>“It takes 6-8 touches to generate a viable sales lead” &#8211; <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2015/04/takes-6-8-touches-generate-viable-sales-lead-heres-why-gp.html">Business insider</a></p></blockquote><p>Your funnel could include social media, email lists, phone calls and many other things, but the important thing to realise is that <strong>you need to provide value</strong> throughout your funnel.</p><h3>Competitors</h3><p>When developing an online marketing strategy, looking at what your competitors are doing is a great way to work out some things that work (or don’t) so cutting the learning curve.</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://info.conversantmedia.eu/2017-holiday-retail-outlook-report">65% of people are fed up with irrelevant brand content</a></p></blockquote><p>Looking at your competitors also helps you develop an offer and brand that is more appealing than your competitors.</p><h3>Measuring success in your online marketing strategy</h3><p>When it comes to any sort of marketing, <strong>it needs to be measured</strong>. If you don’t measure it you’ve no idea what you’re getting for your money.</p><p><strong>Would you pay a mechanic £1500 when you’ve no idea what he’s done or even if you needed it?</strong></p><p>The great thing about online marketing for your business is that you can track everything. Every single click, every single conversion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven’t already, install <a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a>. (If you need a hand I&#8217;m happy to help)</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/content_by_legacy_id?legacy_id=32133">Overall Content Marketing Strategy Leads to 2,000% Lift in Blog Traffic, 40% Boost in Revenue &#8211; Marketing Sherpa</a></p></blockquote><p>Your online marketing strategy should be across several different platforms, both paid and organic, however only invest time and money in platforms where you know your prospects are.</p><p>Here’s some examples for how to get exposure for your business</p><h3>Instagram</h3><p>Now more than 700 million users, Instagram is over <strong>twice the size of Twitter</strong>, and brands can give value and tell their story on this platform through images.</p><p>Instagram is at a very exciting stage as you can grow a following relatively quickly, however you’re going to want to<strong> jump on this quick</strong> as they’re starting to make Instagram pay to play (like Facebook).</p><h3>Facebook Ads</h3><p>Facebook ads is a true game changer. You want to show an ad to widowed women in their 50’s that are interested in cooking? Business owners who have recently started a business and are looking at accountants? <strong>With Facebook you can.</strong></p><p>The great thing about Facebook advertising is that you can start small and scale when you see results, which makes it a no-brainer for most businesses.</p><h3>Collect Emails</h3><p>If you’ve got a prospect on an email list, you can provide them even more value, guiding them through your sales funnel. Every business should be collecting emails &#8211; accountants, plumbers, roofers, shops.</p><p>Emails are priceless, they allow you to build your brand. Once you’ve got someone on your email list you can get in front of them and provide them even more value.</p><h3>Twitter Strategy</h3><p>Whether it’s Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or any other platform &#8211; you’re on your prospects territory.</p><p>Is your post more interesting than everything else on their feed? Is it worth their time?</p><p>If you’re just broadcasting “buy from me” &#8211; they’re likely not going to. Say you’re sharing an interesting story (your brand story) and providing them real value, you’ll get a fan.</p><h3>Get Blogging</h3><p>Not enough small businesses are doing this, and that’s a fantastic thing for you. <strong>The more you blog, the more visitors you’ll get</strong> from search engines.</p><p>Blogging will establish you as the expert, and get more eyes on you, and more prospects in your funnel.</p><h3>Make some videos</h3><p>With YouTube being the second largest search engine in the world (and owned by Google), you’re missing out if you’re not there. Videos are a great way to showcase what you do, who you are and why you’re interesting.<br /> (Videos are also awesome at helping websites rank in Google)</p><h3>Write on other websites</h3><p>There’s countless opportunities available for you to be able to write on other websites, you’re providing them valuable content, and in return you’re getting exposure from their audience.</p><p>If you’re an accountant, you could write on other peoples business blogs. If you’re a local shop you could write on local blogs. Us, as <a href="http://localhost:8888/wordpress2">Swansea SEO</a> experts, will reach out to other industry blogs.</p><p>Outreach is a great method for SEO, and you’ll get traffic from the blog post itself as well as search engines seeing you as more influential and ranking you higher overall.</p><h2>Scheduling Your Online Marketing Strategy</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Scheduling all this can be tricky. Lots of different businesses handle this in different ways from a list of things to do each month to a calendar.</p><p>I would reccomend using a calendar and adding your jobs to that. If you use Google calendar you can add different people to it so delegation and followup is simpler.</p><h2>Consistency</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you’ve got your marketing plan sorted, be consistent with it because you’ll see better and better results the longer you stick at it and the more effort you put in.</p><p>If you’d like a chat about your marketing strategy, I’m happy to help. Lets have a Skype call, email conversation or a chat on the phone.</p><p>If you’ve got any questions, or if you’d like me to go into more depth on anything, <strong>write a comment below</strong> or reach out!</p><p>[clickfunnels_clickpop delay=&#8221;5&#8243; id=&#8221;7ad4fsiqq5ja3btr&#8221; subdomain=&#8221;simplicityseo&#8221;][/clickfunnels_clickpop]</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://simplicityseo.co.uk/making-your-epic-online-marketing-strategy/">Making your epic online marketing strategy</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://simplicityseo.co.uk">Simplicity SEO</a>.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://simplicityseo.co.uk/making-your-epic-online-marketing-strategy/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
